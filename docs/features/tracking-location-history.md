# Tracking location history

You can set up your own location tracking system using combination of Dawarich and Overland, OwnTracks or GPSLogger. Refer to [Track your location tutorial](/docs/tutorials/track-your-location) for more information on how to set up your own location tracking system. When a mobile application (Overland or OwnTracks) is set up to send data to Dawarich, you can see your location history on the map, as well as in the form of points and routes.
