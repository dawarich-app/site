# Dawarich Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. We only collect the personal information that is necessary to provide you with our services, and we do not sell or rent your data to anyone else.

This policy has been created to provide transparency to you about what personal information we collect and the purposes for doing so.

## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Dawarich application ("Application") and related services, including the iOS app,self-hosted, SaaS (Software as a Service), and hosted versions provided to Patreon subscribers of the "hosted dawarich" tier. Dawarich is developed by ZeitFlow UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt) ("Service Provider"). This policy describes how data is handled within Dawarich and your privacy rights.

## What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

### Self-Hosted Version
If you self-host Dawarich, no information is collected or transmitted by the Service Provider. Any data you process remains under your control and responsibility.

### SaaS Version
For users of the Dawarich SaaS service, we may collect and store the following data for functionality, security, and service improvements:
- **User account information**
- **Location history data**
- **Analytics and performance metrics** (anonymized)

This data is used solely for providing the Dawarich service and is not shared with third parties except where necessary for operation (e.g., hosting providers, database storage, bug tracking).

### What data is being processed and stored?

#### User account information

User data is being collected from the user when they sign up for the SaaS version of Dawarich and used to provide the service.

- **Email address**
- **Password**
- **User ID**
- **User status**
- **User settings**

#### Location history data

Location data is being collected from the user when they explicitly upload their location history to the application. This data is used to provide the service: visualize user's location history and calculate statistics.

- **Location data**
- **Device information**
- **Application usage data**
- **Error logs**

#### Analytics and performance metrics

Analytics and performance metrics are being collected from the user when they use the SaaS version of Dawarich. This data is used to improve the service: analyze usage patterns, identify and fix bugs, and enhance the user experience.

- **Usage data**
- **Error logs**
- **Performance metrics**
- **Device information**
- **Application usage data**

### How data is being stored?

All data is being stored on the Service Provider's infrastructure. This includes encrypted database storage and backups. All data is being transferred over HTTPS and stored in the EU. Logs and error traces can be sent to bug tracking services of Service Provider's choice (e.g. Sentry) for further analysis and fixing bugs. Logs are being stored for a maximum of 30 days.

### Hosted Dawarich for Patreon Subscribers
For users subscribed to the "hosted dawarich" tier on Patreon, each instance of Dawarich is hosted individually by the Service Provider on a separate virtual server. The following principles apply:
- **Data Storage:** Each instance is isolated, and user data is stored on its dedicated server.
- **Access Control:** Only the subscriber has access to their hosted instance unless they explicitly grant permissions to others.
- **Service Provider Access:** The Service Provider may access the instance only for maintenance, troubleshooting, or updates, and will not share data with third parties.
- **Data Retention:** If a subscriber cancels their Patreon subscription, their instance and associated data may be deleted after a grace period.

## Does the Application collect precise real-time location information?

Dawarich only collects location data if explicitly enabled by the user. For self-hosted users, location data remains on their own infrastructure. For SaaS and hosted Dawarich users, location data is stored securely and is accessible only to the user.

## Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?

- **Self-Hosted Users:** No data is transmitted to the Service Provider or third parties unless you configure integrations yourself.
- **SaaS Users:** Data is not shared with third parties except where required for service functionality (e.g., cloud hosting, backups, analytics in an anonymized format).
- **Hosted Dawarich Users:** No data is shared with third parties, and access is restricted to the Service Provider for necessary maintenance only.

## Data retention and opt-out options

- **Self-Hosted Users:** You can stop using Dawarich at any time by deleting your installation and associated data.
- **SaaS Users:** You can delete your account and associated data by contacting us at [hi@dawarich.app](mailto:hi@dawarich.app). By default, your data is being kept for a year after your subscription ends. You can also request to delete your data immediately.
- **Hosted Dawarich Users:** You can cancel your Patreon subscription at any time. After cancellation, your instance and data may be deleted after a grace period.

## Children

The Application is not designed for or marketed to children under 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. If you believe that a child has provided personal information, please contact us to request its removal.

## Security

The Service Provider takes data security seriously. For SaaS and hosted Dawarich users, reasonable measures are taken to protect data, including encryption and secure storage. However, self-hosted users are responsible for securing their own deployments.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Users are encouraged to review it regularly for any changes. Continued use of Dawarich constitutes acceptance of any modifications.

This privacy policy is effective as of **12.03.2025**.

## Your Consent

By using Dawarich, whether self-hosted, SaaS, or hosted through Patreon, you consent to the data handling practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## Contact Us
