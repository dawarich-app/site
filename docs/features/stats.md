# Stats

Stats page features a summary of your data, as well as stats by year and by month. You can also update your stats. Click "Update stats" to update your stats. The update will be done in background and usually takes a few minutes to complete.

Stats are being automatically updated in background every hour.

Click on a year to see stats for that year. Click on a `[Map]` link to see the points on the map for that year. On the year's page, if you click on a month, you will see points for that on the map.
