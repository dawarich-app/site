# Dawarich: carefully preserve your most cherished memories

When we think about memories, we usually imagine photos, videos, or maybe a diary. But what about the places we’ve been, the streets we’ve walked, the roads we’ve taken? That part of the story often gets lost. Dawarich helps turn your everyday routes and special trips into your own map of memories.

## What is Dawarich?

We all use our phones for maps and navigation. The problem is, Big Brothers save this data on their servers, which means they know where you’ve been, how often you travel, and sometimes even guess your habits. If that feels uncomfortable, Dawarich is a refreshing alternative.

Dawarich is a service that lets you keep a personal record of your movements and places you’ve visited. The key difference? You’re in charge. You can run it yourself on your own server or computer (and we now have an iOS app too!), so nobody else has access to your location history.

## Main Features

Track your journeys: Dawarich saves your routes, distances, and the places you’ve been.

See your "life map": Look back at your travels, runs, bike rides, or even your daily routes.

Add memories: If you already use photo storage apps like Immich or Photoprism, you can set up syncing and create short photo notes from your travels!

Privacy first: All information is stored where you choose. We make daily backups and database encryption, an SSL certificate is used for data transfer, and hosted in Europe (Frankfurt and Falkenstein, Germany).

## Useful

- For travelers: keep track of countries, cities, and kilometers you’ve explored.
- For close friends and family: Share vacation and travel locations and create a memory map.
- For fitness enthusiasts: log your distances and routes privately, without sharing with third parties.
- For data-driven persons: enjoy the peace of mind knowing your data is truly yours.

Dawarich is like a private diary for your journeys: digital, secure, and completely under your control. You decide whether to keep it just for yourself, share it with close family, or connect it with other tools.
