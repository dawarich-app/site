## How to enter Dawarich console?
<details>
  <summary>Show me!</summary>

  Dawarich built using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), so you can use the Rails console to interact with the application. To enter the console, run the following on your server:

  ```bash
  docker exec -it dawarich_app /bin/sh
  bin/rails console
  ```

## My distance is off, how can I fix it?

<details>
  <summary>Show me!</summary>

  If you find that the distance in your stats is off, it might indicate a problem either in your data or in the importing process.

  In either case, what you want to look for are the points with coordinates `0,0`. These are the points that Dawarich couldn't process correctly. You can find them by running the following command in the Rails console:

  ```ruby
  # Getting all points with coordinates 0,0
  points = Point.where(latitude: 0, longitude: 0)

  # showing amount of such points
  points.size
  ```

  If there are any points with coordinates `0,0`, you can safely delete them by running:

  ```ruby
  points.destroy_all
  ```

  If you find points such as this, it would be great if you could open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/issues) with your import file structure (you can alter your real coordinates, of course) so we can investigate the issue further.

## How to speed up the import process?

<details>
  <summary>Show me!</summary>

  If you have a large import file, you might want to speed up the import process. You can do this by increasing the number of Sidekiq workers. To do this, you can update your `docker-compose.yml` file to include multiple instances of the `sidekiq` service, basically, having copies of an original one under different names. Here's an example of how you can do this:

  ```yaml
  services:
    dawarich_app:
      ...
    dawarich_sidekiq:
      ...
    // highlight-start
    dawarich_sidekiq_1:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
    volumes:
      - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems
      - public:/var/app/public
      ...
    depends_on:
      - dawarich_db
      - dawarich_redis
      - dawarich_app
    dawarich_sidekiq_2:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
    volumes:
      - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems
      - public:/var/app/public
      ...
    depends_on:
      - dawarich_db
      - dawarich_redis
      - dawarich_app
    dawarich_sidekiq_N:
    image: freikin/dawarich:latest
    container_name: dawarich_sidekiq
    volumes:
      - gem_cache:/usr/local/bundle/gems
      - public:/var/app/public
      ...
    depends_on:
      - dawarich_db
      - dawarich_redis
      - dawarich_app
    // highlight-end
  ```

  Note, that additional Sidekiq containers are named `dawarich_sidekiq_2`, `dawarich_sidekiq_N`, etc. You can have as many as you need. You can scale them down when your import is completed. It's imortant to remember that the more workers you have, the more resources they will consume, and connecting to the database might become a bottleneck.

## Why my attempt to import Records.json fails?

<details>
  <summary>Show me!</summary>

  The `Records.json` file you getting with you Google Takeout is usually a big one, and importing it might take a while. If you're getting an error that ends with `Killed`, it means that the process was killed by the system because it consumed too much memory. The solution would be to allocate more memory to the Docker container. You can do this by updating the `docker-compose.yml`:

  ```yaml
  services:
    dawarich_app:
      ...
    dawarich_sidekiq:
      ...
    dawarich_db:
      ...
    dawarich_redis:
      ...
    // highlight-start
    dawarich_app:
      ...
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.001'
          memory: 5G
      ...
    // highlight-end
  ```

  Also, you can try splitting your `Records.json` file into smaller parts and importing them one by one. This way, you can avoid the memory issue. Here you can find a [script](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/issues/142#issuecomment-2268865499) that can help you with splitting the file.

## Why I have so many failed jobs in Sidekiq?

<details>
  <summary>Show me!</summary>

  If your import process finished successfully, you have nothing to worry about. Failed jobs in Sidekiq are usually the a failed attempt of Reverse Geocoding, so you can safely ignore them. This happens when API limit is reached.

  By default, Dawarich uses [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) which limits the number of requests per second. Your options are to wait for a while and try again, or to set up your own instance of reverse geocoding service. You can find more information on how to do this in the [Reverse Geocoding](https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/reverse-geocoding#setting-up-your-own-reverse-geocoding-service) section of the documentation.
