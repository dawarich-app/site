# üì± Automating Tracking with Shortcuts

Dawarich iOS app supports automation using the Shortcuts app by exposing the following actions:

## ‚úÖ Tips

- You can set several **locations** or **time-based triggers** for custom automation.
- Use **if conditions** in shortcuts to add logic (e.g., only upload tracks if connected to home Wi-Fi).
- **Automation permissions**: After the first run, the Shortcuts app may ask for confirmation to run custom actions‚Äîapprove them to allow background automation.
